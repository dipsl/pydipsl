“Make your code tastier and serve your parameters with a nice DIP!”

## Introduction

DIPSL, or shorter DIP, is a serialization language for dimensional input parameters.
PyDIPSL is an implementation of DIPSL for Python.
It was created in order to make initial conditions of physical codes easier and systematic.
Among many interesting features, the most important characteristic are:

* hierarchical structure of the settings
* clear description of parameters
* validation of parameter values
* support for physical units
