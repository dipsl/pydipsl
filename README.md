“Make your code tastier and serve your parameters with a nice DIP!”

## Introduction

DIPSL, or shorter DIP, is a serialization language for dimensional input parameters.
It was created in order to make initial conditions of physical codes easier and systematic.
Among many interesting features the most important characteristic are:

* hierarchical structure of the settings
* clear description of parameters
* validation of parameter values
* support for physical units

More information, examples and description can be found in [HTML documentation](https://dipsl.github.io/dippy).
